Since the project is in highly development pace, we appreciate all the feedback we get from testing our project. So in order to optimize our work we have define a [template](https://github.com/tamiat/tamiat/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) on how to open an Issue.

## Git workflow

Our git workflow is simple and straight forward. There are two main branches, `master` and `develop`

`master`: Is the stable branch. It contains the latest stable version released.

`develop`: The developing branch is used to prepare the next version. It contains the new features and bug fixes.

## How to create a pull request?
